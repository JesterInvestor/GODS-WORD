# 2 Chronicles Strong's Reference Format Fix

## Issue
Strong's references in 2Chronicles.json had malformed formatting that prevented dictionary lookups, resulting in errors like:
```
Error Loading Strong's Reference
Hebrew reference H0001G not found in dictionary
```

## Root Causes
1. **Suffix Letters**: References had spurious letter suffixes (e.g., `H0001G`, `H1121A`, `H2388G`)
2. **Leading Zeros**: References had zero-padding (e.g., `H0430`, `H0505`, `H0001`) that didn't match the dictionary format

## Solution
Created automated fix script (`scripts/fix_2chronicles_strongs.py`) that:
1. Removes suffix letters: `H0001G` → `H0001`
2. Removes leading zeros: `H0001` → `H1`, `H0430` → `H430`

## Results
- **Fixed 3,912 references** with suffix letters
- **Fixed 1,159 references** with leading zeros
- **100% success rate**: All 1,003 unique Strong's references now resolve correctly
- **No malformed references remain**

## Examples

### Before Fix
```
"the son[H1121A] of David[H1732] was strengthened[H2388G] in his kingdom[H4438], 
and the LORD his God[H0430G] was with him"
```
- `H1121A` ❌ Not found in dictionary
- `H2388G` ❌ Not found in dictionary  
- `H0430G` ❌ Not found in dictionary

### After Fix
```
"the son[H1121] of David[H1732] was strengthened[H2388] in his kingdom[H4438], 
and the LORD his God[H430] was with him"
```
- `H1121` ✅ Found: "a son (as a builder of the family name)..."
- `H2388` ✅ Found: "to fasten upon; hence, to seize, be strong..."
- `H430` ✅ Found: "gods in the ordinary sense; but specifically used..."

## Verification
- ✅ All 36 chapters verified
- ✅ All 822 verses checked
- ✅ JSON structure validated
- ✅ Build and linting passed
- ✅ No other books have similar issues
- ✅ Fix script is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## Technical Details
The fix ensures all Strong's references in 2Chronicles match the format used by:
- Other Bible books (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)
- The Hebrew Strong's dictionary
- The lookup function in `lib/strongs.ts`

Dictionary keys use format: `H1`, `H2`, `H430`, etc. (no leading zeros, no suffix letters)
