# 1 Timothy Fix Summary

## Date: January 2025

## Problem Statement

The 1 Timothy file had arrows (➔) in the text and potential structure issues that needed to be addressed.

Example from the issue:
> "ht thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach ➔ no other doctrine."

## Issues Found

1. **88 arrow symbols (➔)** scattered throughout the text
2. **Severe structural corruption**: Each chapter contained all previous chapter verses plus its own
   - Chapter 1: 20 verses (correct)
   - Chapter 2: 35 verses (should be 15) - contained all of Ch 1 + Ch 2
   - Chapter 3: 51 verses (should be 16) - contained all of Ch 1-3
   - Chapter 4: 67 verses (should be 16) - contained all of Ch 1-4
   - Chapter 5: 92 verses (should be 25) - contained all of Ch 1-5
   - Chapter 6: 113 verses (should be 21) - contained all of Ch 1-6
   - **Total: 378 verses (should be 113)**
3. **5 apostrophe encoding issues**: Straight apostrophes (') instead of curly (')
