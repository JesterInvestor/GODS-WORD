# 2 Chronicles Verification Report

## Date: January 2025

## Objective

Verify the text of 2 Chronicles against other KJV versions to ensure:

1. No arrows or special symbols present
2. Text accuracy compared to authoritative KJV sources
3. Proper punctuation per KJV standard
4. Consistent Strong's number formatting
5. No missing or malformed data

## Verification Process

### 1. Reference Source

- **Primary Reference**: aruljohn/Bible-kjv repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/aruljohn/Bible-kjv
- **Type**: Authoritative KJV text source
- **License**: Public domain

### 2. Methodology

Comprehensive automated verification script that checked:

#### Text Accuracy

- Compared all 822 verses against reference KJV
- Normalized text by removing Strong's numbers and em tags
- Verified word-for-word accuracy
- **Result**: ✅ 100% match - all verses identical to reference

#### Arrow Detection

Checked for all possible arrow symbols:

- Unicode arrows: → ← ↑ ↓ ⇒ ⇐ ➜ ➔ ⟶ ⟵ ⟷ ⇄ ⇌ ↔
- ASCII arrows: --> <-- => <= -> <-
- **Result**: ✅ No arrows found

#### Strong's Number Validation

- Validated format: `[H####]` or `[H####X]` where # is digit, X is optional letter
- Checked for malformed or incomplete Strong's references
- Verified bracket matching (open/close pairs)
- **Result**: ✅ All Strong's numbers properly formatted

#### Punctuation Analysis

- Compared ending punctuation with reference
- Verified proper sentence-ending marks
- Confirmed KJV-standard use of colons and semicolons
- **Result**: ✅ Punctuation matches reference exactly

Note: Some verses end with colons (`:`) or semicolons (`;`) rather than periods. This is correct per KJV standard, as these verses continue into the next verse.

#### Whitespace and Formatting

- Checked for double spaces
- Verified no tab characters
- Ensured no leading/trailing whitespace
- **Result**: ✅ No whitespace issues
