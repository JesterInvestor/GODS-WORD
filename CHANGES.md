# Bible Data Corrections

## Overview
This document describes the corrections made to corrupted JSON files in the Bible data.

## Files Fixed

### Mark.json
**Issue**: Missing 4 verses that are included in the standard KJV
**Solution**: Added the following verses with Strong's Concordance numbers:
- **Mark 7:16**: "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
- **Mark 9:44**: "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
- **Mark 9:46**: "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
- **Mark 11:26**: "But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."
- **Mark 15:28**: "And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors."

**Note**: These verses are sometimes omitted in modern translations due to textual criticism, but they are part of the traditional KJV and have been restored.

### 1Kings.json
**Issue**: Missing entire chapter 22 (53 verses)
**Solution**: Added complete chapter 22 with Strong's Concordance numbers, covering the story of Ahab's death and Jehoshaphat's reign.

### 2Chronicles.json
**Issue**: Severe data corruption with many chapters having incorrect verse counts and duplicated content
**Solution**: 
1. Initially replaced entire file with corrected version from authoritative KJV source (aruljohn/Bible-kjv)
2. Subsequently added Strong's Concordance numbers using STEPBible TAHOT (Translators Amalgamated Hebrew OT) data

**Strong's Numbers Addition Process**:
- Source: STEPBible-Data TAHOT files (Hebrew OT with Strong's numbers)
- Method: Automated word matching and manual verification
- Coverage: 789 of 822 verses (96%) now include Strong's numbers on significant words
- Pattern: Similar to 1 Chronicles - Strong's added to proper nouns, key verbs, and important nouns while leaving common function words unmarked

## Verification

All corrected files have been verified to have:
- Valid JSON structure
- Correct number of chapters according to KJV
- Correct verse counts per chapter
- Complete verse text
- No empty or missing verses

## Data Sources

- **Mark.json**: Manual restoration with Strong's numbers based on KJV text
- **1Kings.json**: Manual restoration of chapter 22 with Strong's numbers based on KJV text
- **2Chronicles.json**: 
  - KJV text from [aruljohn/Bible-kjv](https://github.com/aruljohn/Bible-kjv) repository
  - Strong's numbers from [STEPBible-Data](https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data) TAHOT files

## Files Verified as Correct

The following files mentioned in the original issue were verified and found to be correct:
- Isaiah.json
- Acts.json
- 1Corinthians.json
- Philemon.json

No changes were made to these files.

## Build Verification

The application has been successfully built and tested with the corrected files. All linting and TypeScript validation passed.

## Future Improvements

For 2Chronicles:
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Strong's Concordance numbers have been added (96% coverage)
- Potential enhancement: Add Strong's to remaining 33 verses that lacked TAHOT data
- Optional: Manual review and verification of automated Strong's number assignments
