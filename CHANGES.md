# Bible Data Corrections

## Overview
This document describes the corrections made to corrupted JSON files in the Bible data.

## Files Fixed

### Mark.json
**Issue**: Missing 4 verses that are included in the standard KJV
**Solution**: Added the following verses with Strong's Concordance numbers:
- **Mark 7:16**: "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear."
- **Mark 9:44**: "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
- **Mark 9:46**: "Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."
- **Mark 11:26**: "But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."
- **Mark 15:28**: "And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors."

**Note**: These verses are sometimes omitted in modern translations due to textual criticism, but they are part of the traditional KJV and have been restored.

### 1Kings.json
**Issue**: Missing entire chapter 22 (53 verses)
**Solution**: Added complete chapter 22 with Strong's Concordance numbers, covering the story of Ahab's death and Jehoshaphat's reign.

### 2Chronicles.json
**Issue**: Severe data corruption with many chapters having incorrect verse counts and duplicated content
**Solution**: Replaced entire file with corrected version from authoritative KJV source (aruljohn/Bible-kjv)

**Note**: The replacement file contains accurate KJV text but does not include Strong's Concordance numbers. This is a known limitation due to availability of sources with both complete text and Strong's numbers.

## Verification

All corrected files have been verified to have:
- Valid JSON structure
- Correct number of chapters according to KJV
- Correct verse counts per chapter
- Complete verse text
- No empty or missing verses

## Data Sources

- **Mark.json**: Manual restoration with Strong's numbers based on KJV text
- **1Kings.json**: Manual restoration of chapter 22 with Strong's numbers based on KJV text
- **2Chronicles.json**: Complete replacement from [aruljohn/Bible-kjv](https://github.com/aruljohn/Bible-kjv) repository

## Files Verified as Correct

The following files mentioned in the original issue were verified and found to be correct:
- Isaiah.json
- Acts.json
- 1Corinthians.json
- Philemon.json

No changes were made to these files.

## Build Verification

The application has been successfully built and tested with the corrected files. All linting and TypeScript validation passed.

## Future Improvements

For 2Chronicles, future work could include adding Strong's Concordance numbers to match the format of other books in the repository. This would require either:
1. Finding an authoritative source with both complete KJV text and Strong's numbers
2. Manual annotation of the text with Strong's numbers from a concordance
