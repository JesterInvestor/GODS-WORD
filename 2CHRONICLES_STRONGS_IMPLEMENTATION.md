# 2 Chronicles Strong's Numbers Implementation

## Overview

Successfully added Strong's Concordance numbers to 2 Chronicles using STEPBible TAHOT data.

## Implementation Details

### Date

October 9, 2025

### Source Data

- **Primary Source:** STEPBible-Data TAHOT (Translators Amalgamated Hebrew OT)
- **Repository:** https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data
- **File:** `Translators Amalgamated OT+NT/TAHOT Jos-Est - Translators Amalgamated Hebrew OT - STEPBible.org CC BY.txt`
- **License:** Creative Commons BY

### Process

1. **Data Extraction:** Parsed TAHOT tab-delimited format to extract Hebrew words, English glosses, and Strong's numbers
2. **Word Matching:** Implemented automated word-matching algorithm to align English KJV text with Hebrew Strong's numbers
3. **Filtering:** Excluded grammatical markers (H9xxx series) and common function words
4. **Validation:** Verified JSON structure, built application successfully, tested famous verses

### Coverage Statistics

- **Total verses:** 822
- **Verses with Strong's:** 789 (96%)
- **Verses without Strong's:** 33 (4%)
- **Pattern:** Similar to 1 Chronicles - Strong's added to significant words (proper nouns, key verbs, important nouns)

### Implementation Script

Created `scripts/add_strongs_2chronicles.py` which:

- Loads TAHOT data and filters relevant entries
- Processes each verse, matching English words with Hebrew glosses
- Skips common function words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions)
- Adds first Strong's number to matched significant words
- Preserves original text spacing and punctuation
- Creates automatic backup before modification

### Quality Verification

#### Famous Verses Checked

1. **2 Chronicles 1:1** - First verse with Solomon
2. **2 Chronicles 7:14** - "If my people..." (17 Strong's numbers)
3. **2 Chronicles 20:15** - "The battle is not yours but God's"
4. **2 Chronicles 36:23** - Last verse (Cyrus decree)

#### Sample Output

```
2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people[H5971A], which are called[H7121H] by my name[H8034], shall humble[H3665]
themselves[H5921A], and pray[H6419], and seek[H1245] my face[H6440H], and turn[H7725O]
from their wicked[H7451H] ways[H1870G]; then will I hear[H8085G] from heaven[H8064],
and will forgive[H5545] their sin[H2403B], and will heal[H7495] their land[H0776G].
```

3. `public/data/2Chronicles.json.bak` - Automatic backup (excluded from git)

## Known Limitations

### Verses Without Strong's Numbers (33 verses)

These verses lacked corresponding TAHOT data entries, possibly due to:

- Textual variants between Hebrew sources
- Missing entries in TAHOT data
- Verse numbering differences

### Word Alignment

The automated word matching algorithm:

- Works well for proper nouns and significant words
- May occasionally misalign due to Hebrew-English word order differences
- Has been verified for major verses but full manual review could enhance accuracy

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Complete Coverage:** Add Strong's to remaining 33 verses using alternative sources
2. **Manual Review:** Verify automated assignments for theological accuracy
3. **Enhanced Matching:** Implement more sophisticated NLP alignment algorithms
4. **Cross-Reference:** Validate against Blue Letter Bible or similar authorities

### Maintenance

- Backup file preserved at `public/data/2Chronicles.json.bak`
- Script can be re-run with different parameters if needed
- STEPBible data is actively maintained and can be updated

## Credits
